The other day, I came home exhausted. 

Reflecting on my previous days, I realized that I don't give myself enough time to play as an adult. As kids, playtime is an essential experience of childhood. 

Playing in the backyard dreaming that I was flying next to Peter Pan. Using Mommy's leftover fabric to make dresses and weird robe out of it, and pretending I'm walking at my fashion show. 

At pointless as it seemed, there was this sense of relief and calmness to letting all my worries and frustrations out. Whatever problems I have, my mind returns with clarity allowing me to see and approach my concerns from a different perspective. 

Playtime is not only for kids. It should be required for adults as well. I can't remember the last time I experience such calm and stillness in my life until I started to play.
