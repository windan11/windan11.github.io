I started my coding in 2016, approximately 2 years ago. During that time, I took many breaks, some spanned for at least three months, some only for a couple of days. As I tried to figure out what I want to do with my life, I went through growing pains accepting that being an adult means fulfilling my responsibilities.

Now, what does accepting my responsibilities have to do with coding?

Accepting my responsibilities is a stepping stone in my coding journey. I chose to make web development as my future career. Therefore, all the consequences that come with learning to code are my own. Assuming my responsibilities in learning to code means that I must embrace the discomfort of not knowing everything, maintain my persistence through hours of frustrations in solving a problem, and remind myself regularly that I’m worthy to be a web developer.
 
Every decision is a choice, and every choice results in outcome that I may or may not want. Making that decision means that I’m willing to accept all the possible outcomes.      

Ever since, I dedicated myself to learn to code every day, whether that is 30 minutes of writing code or learning how to create a CSS grid, and etc. I’m making a small progress each and every day. 

What is important is I’m still on this path and I'm happy to be on it.
