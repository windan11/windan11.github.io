title: "I'm Grateful for Growth"

On my website, I called myself a web developer. In reality, my job is in education and my role is unrelated to tech. 

However, this role serves me much more benefits than I've could ever imagined. This past weekend, I had the fortunate opportunity to plan and lead a company-wide training for our corporate centers with a fellow colleague of mine. The time, effort, and stress were worth it. 

Now, I'm not the best at public speaker. In fact, I was afraid the moment I stepped in front of everyone, I would freeze. My message would get lost somewhere because of my nerves. So, I practiced and practiced, and hope that I'd remember my notes. Looking back, there were certain things that I can do better, but I am incredibly happy to have this opportunity to be able to speak in front of everyone and allow myself to grow in more ways than I've could ever asked. 

Mark Twain said this famous quote, "Behind every man, there is a successful woman behind him." 

Well, behind me, there is an incredible group of people who cheer and support me to get where I am today. And that is something that I could not buy or get easily. 

I'm happy to have an opportunity to grow, to get guidance and feedback, and to prove myself that I can do anything as long I put my mind and heart into it.
