title: "I'm Grateful for Growth"

On my website, I called myself a web developer. In reality, my job is in education and my role is unrelated to tech. 

However, this role serves me much more benefits than I've could ever imagined. This past weekend, I had the fortunate opportunity to plan and lead a company-wide training for our corporate centers with a fellow colleague of mine. The time, effort, and stress were worth it in the end. 

Now, I'm not the best public speaker EVER. In fact, I was afraid the moment I stepped on the stage, in front of everyone, I would froze. My message would lost somewhere in my thought because of my nerves. So, I practiced and practiced, and hope that I'll remember my notes. Looking back, there were certain things that I can do better, but I am incredibly happy to have this opportunity to be able to speak in front of everyone and allow myself to grow in more ways than I've could ever asked. 

Mark Twain said a wise quote, "Behind every man, there is a successful woman behind him." Behind me, there is an incredible group of people who cheer and support me to get where I am today. And that is something that you could not buy or get easily. 

I'm happy to have an opportunity to grow, an opportunity to get guidance and feedback, and an opportunity to prove myself that I can do anything as long I put my mind and heart into it.
