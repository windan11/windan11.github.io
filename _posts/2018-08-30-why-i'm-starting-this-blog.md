title: "Why I Started Blogging"

Learning how to program can be a frustrating experience, especially if you're taking the self-taught path. As I mentioned in my first post, I gave up several times before finding myself coming back to it again. 

I want to hold myself accountable and stay on track this time. Blogging is my way keep track of my progress and see how far I come along. 

Originally, I thought blogging would be for people who have something valuable to share. I started writing only to delete what I wrote because it's not worthwhile for others to read. However, after encountering Gary Vaynerchuk's article on the importance of documenting your journey, I shifted my mindset from writing something valuable for others to reflecting on my experiences and what I learn. 

My posts will not come from a place that will be worthy of sharing but from a place where it documents my successes, failures, projects, and anything I learned on this journey. 

Cheers, 

Anh
