title: Day 1 - Random Background
---

This project intends to apply Math.random() to the background using Javascript. Before we dive into the code, let's define some keywords.

<h2> Definition </h2>

<b>Math.random():</b> a function that generates any random decimal number between 0 and 1. 

<b>Math.floor(): </b>a function that takes a number, usually a decimal or a fraction, and rounds it to the nearest whole number

<b>Hex code: </b> a type of color code that computer use to define the colors, which takes the form of #RRGGBB, where R, G, B defines the intensity of the each color using either any integer from 0-9 and letter from A-G. 

<b>Decimal Code:</b> another code representation of color. The code is written in the from rgb(R,G,B) where each value represents the intensity of each color with any value between 0 and 256.

<b>For loop:</b> a statement allows iteration through the letter in a string, or an element in an array or object until a specified condition proves to be false. 

<b>String.length:</b> counts the number of characters in a string. For example, 'abc'.length gives us 3. 

<h2> The Code </h2>

In changing the background to any random color, I have to create a function to perform my task. In this case, it gives me a different background color every time I click the button. In this project, I utilize use the six-value hex code to identify the color.

First, I create a variable that holds onto the all the possible integers and letters that define the colors.  

	var letters = ''0123456789ABCDEFG";
	Var color = '#';
	
To randomly select any value in variable letters, a for loop is used. The code is written as such: 
	
	for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
		color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random()*16)];
	}

Let's say Math.random() gives us 0.54, multiplying by 16 (or letters.length) and applying Math.floor() will result in 9. Letters[9] tells us the index in which we are taking the value from variable letters-- number 9. The variable color will add 9 after the # sign. The for loop will keep going until it has 6 values in color. 

To change the color, simply set the color which contains your new code to the background as such: 

	document.body.style.background = color;
	
I have a click button on my website. In order to perform the task every time I click my button, I call to the function by setting the function name inside the button style. 

Here is the full Javascript code with a snippet of my HTML: 

HTML: 

	<button class="btn animate" onclick= "getRandomColor()"> Click Me!</button>

Javascript: 
	
	function getRandomColor(){
		var letters = '0123456789ABCDEFG';
		var color = '#';
		for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++){
			color += letters[Math.floor(Math.random()*16)];
		}
		document.body.style.background = color;
	}

That's it, folks! My first project for Day 1. Happy coding!
