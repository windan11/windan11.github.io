title: Why I Started A(x)
---

I started many x-day-x-project before, but I always fell off the bandwagon due to the overwhelming experience that comes with learning to code. This time, I'm holding myself accountable of finishing up the projects by writing a blog post after completing each project. The blog will not just be me venting about my frustrations (which I will do at some point). The post will also contain what I learned and the skills I pick up from my projects.

This blog is more for myself than for teaching others. I will revisit keywords, concepts or tools that I used in my project.

To commensurate this journey I'm taking, I want to give meaning to this project and give it a special name. The project is called A(x), pronounced as A of X. The A stands for my initial. X represents any values that I'm willing to put into my projects whether that is the value of hard work, the value of embracing discomfort or perserverance, or even the number of sleepless hours. Whatever result I get will be the product of those values--- certainly, my projects will be one of them.  

Lastly, x represents any finite number of projects that I intend to create either this year, next year, or in my lifetime. I intend to create as many projects as I can because I enjoy creating and (hopefully) it will be one for others to use.
