# Hi, I'm Anh Thach, a Web Developer in Los Angeles, CA.

I enjoy creating from an idea and seeing a project comes to life. When I'm not teaching myself HTML, CSS and Javascript, I enjoy catching up with family and friends over dinners or small gatherings.

Each day, I focus on building and learning best practices in my projects. If you like what you see, let's talk.
