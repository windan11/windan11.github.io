# Hi, I'm Anh Thach, and this is my personal/project-based website.

I enjoy creating from an idea and seeing a project comes to life. When I'm not teaching myself HTML, CSS and Javascript, I enjoy catching up with family and friends over dinners or small gatherings.

Take care of your health and be safe during this uncertain time.
